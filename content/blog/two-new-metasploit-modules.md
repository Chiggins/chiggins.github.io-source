This isn’t really anything super big but still something I’m proud of. I’ve recently gotten two Metasploit exploit modules merged into master, which is pretty cool! You can see what I’ve contributed to Metasploit so far on my contributions page.

Even though what I’ve really been doing is just porting PoC exploits from Exploit-DB, it’s provided a great learning experience with how the Metasploit Framework actually works. For one of the modules I had to dive deep into the frameworks core and try to figure out how SEH and it’s egghunter work, which was huge to me as I really had just learned how egghunting really worked.

Big thanks to the #metasploit IRC community on freenode, they were a huge help. Looking forward to adding new modules when the time comes!
