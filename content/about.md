Hello! I'm Chris Higgins, M.S., OSCP, and this is my website where I'll attempt to post useful bits of what I'm working on or involved in.

I am currently an Associate Consultant at Mandiant, a FireEye company. I am also a committer to the open-source Metasploit project. Currently Iâ€™m interested in penetration testing, exploit development, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and automated infrastructure. I also have a strong hobby for home brewing my own beer, so I'm always up for a good beer discussion!

You can follow me on Twitter [@ch1gg1ns](https://twitter.com/ch1gg1ns), on [GitHub](https://github.com/chiggins), or you can find me on FreeNode as chiggins usually lurking in #metasploit, #burbsec, or #vulnhub.
